## Project Planning

### I read the pdf document I was provided and planned how to work with the requirements of product lists,data fetching, cart management, location services and offline support. 

## Technology Selection

### For the technology I chose React Native and Expo for cross-platform compatibility and ease of Development.

## Development Steps

### Firstly I worked on the initial Setup for Expo, Redux and RTK Query. Then I have worked on the HomeScreen which needed the data from a Mock API including the setups for navigating to different screens. After that I have worked on the Product details page also the initial setup for locations.There was a minor mistake i made. I thought the map needs to be shown in the product details but later I fixed that and worked on the map and the marker in a Mapscreen showing the location of the user. Finally I have added the cart screen functionality using redux which ended the phase 1 development. 

### For phase 2 I have have used Netinfo and AsyncStorage to cache the data to show when the user is offline.

### For Phase 3 I have created a function and a floating section to show the timestamp to render and the timestamp will be updated every 20 seconds. I have used setInterval and clearInterval to update the date and time. 

### Then I changed the UI for Homescreen and Details page to give it a modern look.

### There was some minor issues in building the app which was solved but may be there is still some bugs which I plan to solve in the future and there is also some rerendering issues in Mapscreen which could not be solved due to time constraint but planning to solve in the future.
